    project: New embolic agents
    biog: In 2015, I graduated from the University of Sheffield with a Masters degree in chemistry including industrial experience gained from a years placement at Biocompatibles, a BTG International group company. During the industrial placement, I worked as an innovation technician focusing on the development of radiopaque beads for transarterial embolization being involved with the project as it progressed from early stage research through development to preclinical trial manufacture. The opportunity also arose to extend the placement over summer, during which I worked to provide scientific support for a patent application. For my final year project I was based in the Jones research group at the University of Sheffield specialising in the area of asymmetric synthesis using chiral auxiliaries. The focus of the project was the development of a synthetic route for the preparation of a chiral compound designed to behave as a molecular mimic of an intermediate formed during the biosynthesis of pseudaminic acid within the flagellum of bacteria. Thereby, behaving as a novel antibiotic for pathogenic bacteria.

    project: Oxidation-responsive materials for targeting inflammation
    biog: I graduated from the University of Sheffield in 2015 with a masters degree in chemistry. During my undergraduate degree, I spent 10 weeks of my summer break working with Professor Armes research group at the University of Sheffield. The aim of this short project was to synthesise PMAA-b-PBzMA and PAA-b-PST block copolymers via the RAFT aqueous emulsion polymerisation. Through this I found that I had an interest in polymer chemistry, which ultimately influenced my decision to apply for a PhD in this field. My masters project focused on using molecular modelling programs, such as Gaussian 09, in order to determine the energy of astrochemical reactions. In particular, the objective to resolve why there is a large abundance of methyl formate, rather than the more kinetically stable isomer, glycoaldehyde, near hot cores of young stellar objects. To do this possible reaction routes were modelled and the influence of hydrogen bonding on the energy of these was determined.

    project: Oxidation-responsive materials for targeting inflammatory diseases
    biog: I am a PhD student working on designing a drug delivery system for inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. In both of these diseases reactive oxygen species (ROS) attack and damage areas of the body which is called inflammation. These diseases are treated with disease modifying drugs which are non-targeted and can cause serious side effects. If the drugs used were targeted to areas of inflammation only then doses could be lowered and side effects reduced. This work has focused on using oxidation sensitive materials that would respond to ROS in the areas of inflammation. Specifically we are looking to design a polymer nanoparticle that will encapsulate drug and when inflammation of the disease occurs release the drug due to the oxidation sensitivity.
